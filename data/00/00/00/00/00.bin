  |   Road Redemption is an action racing game where you lead your          |
  |   motorcycle gang on an epic journey of pursuit, blood, and speed.      |

  |   In the fiery remnants of a once vibrant world, gangs battle for       |
  |   dominance across wartorn highways.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   When a motorcycle assassin takes out the boss of the richest          |
  |   weapons cartel, the cartel offers a bounty of wealth beyond           |
  |   imagination for the assassin's head.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Now every thug, warrior, and bounty hunter with a bike and blade is   |
  |   out to catch the assassin and win the bounty, including you. The      |
  |   race is on.                                                           |

  |   To succeed, you'll have to fight your way across the country,         |
  |   through both friendly and rival gang territory, with whatever         |
  |   weapons you can get your hands on: swords, shotguns, baseball bats,   |
  |   sledge hammers, pipe bombs, and so much more.                         |

  |   You'll need to use what you earn and learn along the way to upgrade   |
  |   yourself, your ride, and your weapons. The path to glory and riches   |
  |   is a long one paved in blood and pain, but luckily you've got a       |
  |   fast bike.                                                            |
